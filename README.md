User stories
----

```
As a user,
So that I can show off how amazing my life is;
I want to be able to display my beautiful photos for the world to see.

As a user,
So that I can check how popular I am
I want to be able for people to 'like' my posts.

As a user,  
So others can enjoy my posts even more
I want to be able to give them clearly clever captions; to make my chums chortle.


As a user,  
So I can ensure others really understand the deep and meaningful image of a bag blowing in the wind,
I want to be able to give my posts a description

As a user,
I am incredibly busy taking very important  photos,
So I want to be able to sign in via Facebook and save time not having to sign up to yet another website.

As a user,  
I need to know how iconic my posts are and know I have worth in my life,
So I want other users to be able to leave comments on my posts.

As a user,
I want to be able to destroy posts
So that of if in the future I decide that I really shouldn't have included that reeeeaalllllyyy drunk photo I can save face.
```
